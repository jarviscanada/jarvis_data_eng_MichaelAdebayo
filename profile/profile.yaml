summary: My name is Michael Adebayo. I hold a Bachelor of Science Honors degree in Computer Science from Trent University. My professional journey began as a Performance Test Analyst at CIBC where I tested the performance of applications, and I am currently employed at Jarvis as a Junior Software Engineer. What excites me about the software industry is its constant evolution and the immense potential it offers to achieve unimaginable things. I am particularly passionate about artificial intelligence and big data and what it can bring for us as a people, and I am eager to explore the possibilities these fields present.
